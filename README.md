# SF Parking Pal

SF Parking Pal (SFPP) lets users street park without getting tickets.

## How to use it

Using [SFMTA](https://data.sfgov.org/widgets/ab4h-6ztd) data, SFPP finds the most common parking tickets given on the block you're going to park on, how frequently they're given, and at what times. You can check out the citations yourself on a map or read through our suggestions of how safe it is to park there!


## How it works
Type in an address, and the app will look through all parking citations from the beginning of 2022 to today.
